1. I want to make the file system more efficient. Need to experiment with ways in which to do this.

2. Clean up the code by using helper functions to organize things better.

3. Definitely some data leakage happening. I need to create a new feature matrix that contains only variables not known at the time of the event.
    a. With this, looking at different correlations with the in game stats
    b. This could get into game theory land

4. There are so many determining factors, that it might be more beneficial to analyze things from a one player perspective. Projections could be for in game stats per player.

5. Other variables to consider:
    a. Time of possession
    b. Ranking of defensive/offensive line
    c. could really be considering scraping data from other sources
    
6. Just discovered the __init__.py package enabler for python
